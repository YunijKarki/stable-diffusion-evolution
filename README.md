# Under the Hood Working Mechanism of Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a powerful text-to-image model. There are now countless websites and tools to generate cool looking images in a flash of second. But, very few people have understood the true essence of its working mechanism. There are so many factors like how noise plays such a crucial role in behind the smooth creation of these images.Let's dig deeper and create an evolution of image from its densely noised version.

The video above tells the journey of a densely noised image to a denoised version. I have only taken 50 inference steps in order to keep it short.Lets relive the magic of stable diffusion...
